One-Way Directory Synchronizer

Usage: <source> <replica> <log> <interval>

Interval must be a positive integer, representing time in seconds.
Source, replica, and log paths must be independent of each other.

Directories are compared periodically.
A full comparison is performed every cycle:
First, files with the same name are matched by modification date and size.
Then, they are compared by hash, if date and size matches.

All source directory changes are logged separately using FileSystemWatcher.
The project is covered by both unit tests and end-to-end tests.

Jenkins was used to test in multiple environments.
Two agents were set up:
One running on Windows,
One running on WSL (Linux).
This allowed testing across different file systems.
